This record is intended to help you check your playing equipment
Without the use of measurement instruments
And remembering that the ultimate aim
Is to produce sound which is completely acceptable to the listener
I'm tired of fake fortunes being sold
I'm tired of my tires burning rubber on the roads
Tired of the distance, the lengths that I go to
Trying to get a bit of credit from you
Fuck that, real love feels real
So I don't need to try to synthesize the feel
I'm tryna unlock doors with these musical keys
My friends puff trees, turn the Z to a G
Oh no
And all I do is twinkle the ivory keys
Indulgently, 'cause I do this for me
I know
And it just feels a little bit like
Somebody cut a hole in my pockets
'Cause I've been tryna to do this right
With no profits and the loss I can't stop it
And consumption lies at the heart of my bad habits
I live in a world where I want but can't have it
Tell me why that is the way it is
I need some real love, to feel real
But people all around me still try to leave the ties that feel
I'm tryna to unlock doors with these musical keys
Eventually I smoke a Z to a G
Oh no
And all I do is twinkle the ivory keys
It's no wonder why I make no P's
I know
But it just feels a little bit like
Somebody cut a hole in my pockets
'Cause I've been trying to do this right
With no profits and the loss I can't stop it
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
It just feels a little bit like
Somebody cut a hole in my pockets
'Cause I've been tryna to do this right
With no profits and the loss I can't stop it
And it just feels a little bit like
Somebody cut a hole in my pockets
'Cause I've been tryna to do this right
With no profits and the loss I can't stop it
